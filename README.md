Welcome to the Ruby + AI Hacking Fest! This online hackathon is a weekend-long event starting on Friday night, May 17th, and concluding on Sunday afternoon, May 19th. The goal is to create a boilerplate Rails application using any existing, publicly available AI model. Participants will integrate the model into their Rails application via API, ensuring it runs seamlessly on a local machine.
